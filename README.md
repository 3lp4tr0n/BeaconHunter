# BeaconHunter

Behaviour based monitoring and hunting tool built in C# tool leveraging ETW tracing. Blue teamers can use this tool to detect and respond to potential beacons. Red teamers can use this tool to help improve their opsec and discover new processes that behave like beacons.

### TL;DR
Beacon implants injected in a benign process live in a thread with a `Wait:DelayExecution` state (probably related to Cobalt Strike's `sleep`).

Find all processes that contain a thread in a `Wait:DelayExecution` state. 

Leverage ETW tracing to specifically monitor suspicious thread's activity: 
  - network callbacks
  - file (`cd`,`ls`,`upload`,`rm`)
  - process termination (`kill`)
  - shell commands (`run`,`execute`)
  - registry (TODO)
  - wmi (TODO)

Score suspicious behavior. Log, display, and take action against them.
